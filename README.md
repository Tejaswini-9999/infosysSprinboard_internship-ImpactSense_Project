# 🌍 ImpactSense – Earthquake Impact Prediction 🚨

> 🧠 A Machine Learning project to **predict earthquake impact** (magnitude, risk zones, and damage levels)  
> using **geophysical and environmental data** for early disaster planning, emergency response, and awareness.  

---

## 📌 Project Statement  

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning-based predictive model that aims to **predict the severity of earthquakes**  in terms of magnitude, damage level, or risk zone classification. The system will utilize geophysical
and environmental data like 🌐 latitude, longitude | 🌊 depth | 🌋 seismic features | 🏔️ geological parameters to assess
the possible damage or categorize the earthquake severity. This can help in early disaster planning, emergency
response, and awareness campaigns.

✅ Helps in **urban planning, risk assessment, disaster response,** and **infrastructure safety.**

## 🔥 Use Cases  

| Use Case | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| 🏙️ **Urban Risk Assessment** | Authorities predict earthquake impact in populated areas | Predict high-risk zones during a 5.5 magnitude quake |
| 🏗️ **Infrastructure Planning** | Guide construction policies in risky regions | Risk level based on soil density & fault lines |
| 🚑 **Govt. Disaster Response** | Prioritize rescue & aid based on risk | Rank regions for aid delivery post-earthquake |
